title: Differentially Private Regression with Gaussian Processes
abstract: A major challenge for machine learning is increasing the availability of
  data while respecting the privacy of individuals. Here we combine the provable privacy
  guarantees of the differential privacy framework with the flexibility of Gaussian
  processes (GPs). We propose a method using GPs to provide differentially private
  (DP) regression. We then improve this method by crafting the DP noise covariance
  structure to efficiently protect the training data, while minimising the scale of
  the added noise. We find that this cloaking method achieves the greatest accuracy,
  while still providing privacy guarantees, and offers practical DP for regression
  over multi-dimensional inputs. Together these methods provide a starter toolkit
  for combining differential privacy and GPs.
